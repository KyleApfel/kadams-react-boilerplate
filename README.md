# Kyle's React Boilerplate! 

## Synopsis
Using https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot as the bones, I built, in my opinion, a more agreeable file and folder structure. <br/><br/>

Components/Containers are now encapsulated in the folder "features", when a new feature is needed, simply duplicate the `src/features/blank` folder with the desired name. Then change out the name of the components, containers, and reducers to get your new feature. Add new reducers in `src/reducers/index.js`, and routes in `src/routes.js`. <br/><br/>

Happy Coding!

## Get Started

1. `npm i && npm start`
2. Done
3. Play around!

## Tools

I've automated the creation of features or "dynamic components". Simply run `./featurecreation.sh helloworld"` to create your new feature! 
3. Have fun!
