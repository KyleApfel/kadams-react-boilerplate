# Kyle's React Boilerplate! 

## Synopsis
Using https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot as the bones, I built, in my opinion, a more agreeable file and folder structure.Components/Containers are now encapsulated in the folder "features", when a new feature is needed, simply duplicate the `blank` folder.

## Get Started

1. `npm i && npm start`
2. Done
3. Play around!

## Tools

I've automated the creation of features or "dynamic components". Simply run `./featurecreation.sh helloworld"` to create your new feature!
